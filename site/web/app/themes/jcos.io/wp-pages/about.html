    Hello, my name is John Cosio. Iâ€™m a programmer, webmaster and all-around computer guy.

    I build websites from simple blog pages to complicated E-commerce sites.

    Tools of the trade: PHP, Java, JSP, Servlets, Jquery, AngularJS, MVC, WordPress, Front end development and responsive mobile web design.

    Java is not my cup ofâ€¦. water. Not much of a coffee or tea drinker. Too complicated for me and back in college I used to skip classes. hahahaha

    Not funny? Okay, let's forget that happened. ðŸ™‚

    Check out this <a href="https://jcos.io/work/">page</a> to see my work and related info..

    No need for fancy buzzwords, feel free to <a href="https://jcos.io/contact/">contact</a> me if I could be of any help.

            My addiction or enthusiasm with computer games started when I was very little. I've started a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRHhhzP8dUEp_PS9eNUU2-A" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouTube channel</a> to upload gameplay and other game related contents.
            Streaming on Twitch can be a possibility in the future.

            My take take on things around me and adding a little twist to common words and sentences. I'll draw puns inspired by <a href="https://www.chrisbutlercollection.com/just-for-pun" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chris Butler collection</a> and funny comics from the <a href="https://theoatmeal.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Oatmeal</a>.
